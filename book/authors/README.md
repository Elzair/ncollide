# About the authors

As of today, this reference guide and the **ncollide** project are almost
completely developed by me, a French Computer Science student named SÃ©bastien
Crozet (aka. _sebcrozet_). I do that during my free time, trying to help making
Rust a great language for game development or any geometry-based application.
For more informations about my professional background, check out my
[LinkedIn](https://www.linkedin.com/pub/s%C3%A9bastien-crozet/25/875/416/en)
profile.


I also develop a physics engine [nphysics](http://nphysics-dev.org), a
graphics engine [kiss3d](http://kiss3d.org) and a low-dimensional linear algebra
library [nalgebra](http://nalgebra.org). Do not hesitate to use those as freely
as you use **ncollide**!
