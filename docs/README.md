**ncollide** is a 2 and 3-dimensional collision detection library written using
the [Rust](http://rust-lang.org) programming language. Collision detection and
computational geometry in general are ubiquitous in computer physics, graphics
and animation. The involved algorithms are usually non-trivial and require a
great amount of time to get up and running.  To prevent others from spending
significant amount of time re-writing collision detection algorithms,
**ncollide** is available open-source on
[github](http://github.com/sebcrozet/ncollide) and is released under the
permissive [BSD-3](http://opensource.org/licenses/BSD-3-Clause) licence. Feel
free to use (even commercially), modify, and redistribute **ncollide**! See the
[How to contribute](how_to_contribute/index.html) section to learn more about
the authors of this library and the different methods of contribution.

**ncollide** does not have any dedicated chat room or forum yet. However, do
not hesitate to contact directly the authors by
[email](mailto:developer@crozet.re), or to open an
[issue](http://github.com/sebcrozet/ncollide/issues). You may also find the
answer of common questions on the [FAQ](faq/index.html).

## How do we test ncollide?
**ncollide** does not have a lot of unit tests. But that does not mean it is
not tested at all! In the contrary, everything is thoroughly tested in
_real-life_ situations using three other Rust projects:

1. [nphysics](http://nphysics-dev.org) − a 2d and 3d physics engine. It relies
   a lot on contact determination and has at least one example per collision
   detection algorithm provided by **ncollide**.

2. [kiss3d](http://kiss3d.org) − a 3d graphics engine. It relies on mesh
   generation to render everything that is not triangular (sphere, cone, bézier
   surfaces, etc.). In particular it has a
   [demo](https://github.com/sebcrozet/kiss3d/blob/master/examples/procedural.rs)
   that uses most mesh generation algorithms of **ncollide**. In fact, every
   single 3d illustration of the [Mesh generation](mesh_generation/index.html)
   section has been rendered by **kiss3d**.

3. [nrays](https://github.com/sebcrozet/nrays) − a 3d and 4d ray tracer in
   Rust. Obviously, it is used to test the ray-casting capabilities of
   **ncollide**. In fact, most 3d illustration of this guide have been rendered
   by **nrays**.

## About this guide
This guide intends to give a shallow description of most features available on
**ncollide**:
* [Contact determination](contact_determination/index.html) with [spacial
  partitioning](contact_determination/broad_phase.html) techniques are used to
  allow geometric queries on scenes with thousands of objects.
* [Ray casting](ray_casting/index.html) against most shapes supported by
  the library.
* [Mesh generation](mesh_generation/index.html) from the shapes
  supported by the library. This is the process of transforming the implicit
  representation of **ncollide** shapes to triangle-meshes or line strips
  that can be efficiently rendered by the GPU.

[Getting started](getting_started/index.md) explains how to download and
compile **ncollide** from its source code. It also gives the Cargo files needed
to compile the downloadable examples given by this guide.

Note that this is **not** an exhaustive documentation of **ncollide** API. The
complete documentation generated by rustdoc is available online
[here](doc/ncollide).
