# Collision detection pipeline

While detecting proximities and computing contacts between only two objects
might be useful to compute their immediate interactions, we often work with
complex scenes involving thousands of objects. Iterating through each pair of
object and testing each of them for intersection is a $\mathcal{O}(n^2)$
process where $n$ is the number of objects. This is obviously not practicable
in real-time.


To overcome this issue, **ncollide** implements a collision detection pipeline
decomposed into two stages: the [broad phase](#broad-phase) and the [narrow
phase](#narrow-phase). The broad phase has a global knowledge of the position
of every object simultaneously so it can use spacial partitioning with
conservative interference detection algorithms to find all the potential
collision pairs very efficiently: $\mathcal{O}(n \log(n))$ time in average or
even $\mathcal{O}(1)$ if time coherence is high. Then the narrow phase iterates
on those pairs individually and performs the exact geometric query. Note that
some objects paired by the broad phase may not actually be in contact (_false
positives_) as it only performs approximate tests. On the other hand, a broad
phase is guaranteed not to produce any _false negative_: two interfering
objects are always guaranteed to be paired and reported to the narrow phase.


# Broad phase

A broad phase on **ncollide** must implement the `broad_phase::BroadPhase`
trait that ensures that objects can be added, removed, updated, and supports
common geometric queries:

| Method                 | Description                                     |
|--                      | --                                              |
| `.deferred_add(uid, bv, data)`                    | Informs the broad phase algorithm that a new object with the identifier `uid`, the bounding volume `bv`, and the associated data `data` has to be added during the next update. |
| `.deferred_remove(uid)`                           | Informs the broad phase algorithm that the object identified by `uid` must be removed at the next update. |
| `.deferred_set_bounding_volume(uid, bv)`          | Informs the broad phase algorithm that the object identified by `uid`â€™s bounding volume has to be replaced by `bv` at the next update. |
| `.deferred_recompute_all_proximities()` | Forces the broad phase to recompute and re-report all collision pairs at the next update. |
| `.update(filter, callback)`                       | Updates this broad phase algorithm, actually performing pending object additions and removals. `filter` is a predicate that indicates if a new potential collision pair is valid. If it returns `true` for a given pair, `callback` will be called for it. |
| `.interferences_with_bounding_volume(bv, result)` | Fills `result` with references to each object which bounding volume intersects the bounding volume `bv`. |
| `.interferences_with_ray(ray, result)`            | Fills `result` with references to each object which bounding volume intersects the ray `ray`. |
| `.interferences_with_point(point, result)`        | Fills `result` with references to each object which bounding volume contains the point `point`. |

Let us clarify what _associated data_ means here. A broad phase is guaranteed
to associate some pieces of data to each object. Those data are completely
user-defined (e.g. they can even be as general as `Box<Any>`) and are passed as
argument to the user-defined callbacks when the `update` method is called.
Therefore, feel free to store in there any piece of data that may be useful to
identify the object on your side.

Note that methods with names prefixed by `deferred_` have no effect until the
next call to `.update(...)`. This allows the broad phase to perform one global
update even if several objects are moved individually. This update relies on a
collision filter and a callback. First, the filter should always have results
constant wrt. time. _Constant_ means that if at some time the filter returns
`true` (resp. `false`) for some object pair $(\mathcal{A}, \mathcal{B})$, it is
expected to always return `true` (resp. `false`) for $(\mathcal{A},
\mathcal{B})$ at any time in the future as well. If the filter changes at some
point (hence breaking this constancy), the method
`.deferred_recompute_all_proximities()` must be called in order to inform the
broad phase that the (new) filter should be re-executed on all potential
collision pairs already detected. The second closure `callback` passed at
update-time is the bridge between the broad phase and the narrow phase: it will
be called on each potential collision pair that has not been filtered out.

Finally, a broad phase algorithm being inherently incremental, the `callback`
will usually be called only once on each new potential contact pair created or
removed as a consequence of filter change or objects being moved. Pairs
unaffected by recent changes will **not necessarily** be re-reported.

### The Brute Force broad phase
The `broad_phase::BruteForceBroadPhase` is the simplest broad phase with a
$\mathcal{O}(n^2)$ time complexity. It should not be used for anything
but debugging: if you suspect another broad phase implementation to have a bug,
you may want to try the brute-force broad phase and compare its result with the
other one.

### The DBVT broad phase

The `broad_phase::DBVTBroadPhase` is based on a Dynamic Bounding Volume Tree
(DBVT) to detect interferences with an average $\mathcal{O}(n \log(n))$ time
complexity, or even $\mathcal{O}(1)$ if time coherence is high. The
`partitioning::DBVT` structure itself is a proper binary tree that maps a
bounding volume to the object it bounds on its leaves. Internal nodes only
contain a bounding volume that spatially bounds all the leaves of the sub-tree
it is root of. The following figure shows an example of tree that contains a
set of brown objects with their red AABB. Note that, instead of the exact
bounding volumes (red), the `DBVTBroadPhase` stores their loosened version
(black):

<center>
![dbvt](../img/AABB_tree_DBVT.svg)
</center>

Creating an empty `DBVTBroadPhase` is simple using the `::new(margin,
small_keys)` constructor:
```rust
let mut dbvt = DBVTBroadPhase::new(0.02, false);
```
Storing the loosened bounding volumes instead of the exact ones is a
significant optimization for scenes where the broad phase has to track contact
pairs involving slow-moving objects: the DBVT is modified by the broad phase
only when the displacement of an object is large enough to make its exact
bounding volume move out of the loosened version stored on the tree. That way
objects moving at high frequency but low amplitude will almost never trigger an
update, at the cost of slightly less tight bounding volumes for interference
detection. The amount of loosening is controlled by the first constructor
argument `margin`. The second argument `small_keys` is here for optimization
purpose as well.  Set it to `true` if and only if you know that the integer
keys you use to identify your objects are small (as in "small enough for them
to be used as keys on a `Vec` instead of a `HashMap`"). If you are not sure of
the values your keys may take, set `small_keys` to `false`.


The following example creates four balls, adds them to a `DBVTBroadPhase`,
updates the broad phase, and removes some of them.

# Narrow phase
When the broad phase detects pairs of objects that may potentially interact, they
can be passed to the narrow phase which will instantiate the persistent
algorithms to perform exact proximity detections or contact point computations.
The narrow phase is also responsible for notifying the user when an interaction
(proximity, contact, etc.) starts or stops. Every narrow phase must implement
the `narrow_phase::NarrowPhase` trait.

| Method | Description |
|--      | --          |
| `.update(...)` | Updates the narrow phase actually performing contact and proximity computation. |
| `.handle_interaction(..., objs, fk1, fk2, started)` | Tells the narrow phase that the objects given by `objs[fk1]` and `objs[fk2]` start or stop interacting. |
| `.contact_pairs(objs)` | Returns all the contact pairs. |
| `.proximity_pairs(objs)` | Returns all the proximity pairs. |

The `.handle_interaction(...)` method will instantiate the correct persistent
contact or proximity detection algorithm for the given pair of objects. It will
also free those that are no longer relevant, e.g., because the `started` flags
is set to `false`. It will usually not perform any actual geometric query as
this is the task of the `.update(...)` method. Both methods take two _signals_
as arguments: a `ContactSignal` and a `ProximitySignal`. Both are sets of
callbacks that are called when a contact or proximity starts or stops. Hence,
the user may add their own contact and proximity event handlers to those.

The `narrow_phase::DefaultNarrowPhase` is the default implementation of the
narrow phase and should be suitable for most applications. It handles both
persistent proximity detection and persistent contact generation.

## Persistent proximity detection
Persistent proximity detection algorithms differ from the
`query::proximity(...)` [function](../geometric_queries/#proximity) in that the
former require a structure to be instantiated. This structure can then be
re-used over time with the same shapes but with different positions and
proximity margins. This allows the proximity detector to perform significant
optimizations if the positions change only slowly over time âˆ’ this is usually
called _temporal coherence_. A persistent proximity detector must implement the
`narrow_phase::ProximityDetector` trait.

| Method | Description |
|--      | --          |
| `.update(dispatcher, ma, a, mb, b, margin)` | Actually performs the proximity determination between the objects `a` and `b` respectively transformed by `ma` and `mb`. |
| `.proximity(&self)` | Returns the result of the last update. |

For a given proximity dector instance, the shapes `a` and `b` are assumed never
to change over time. Changing them may lead to unexpected results. The `margin`
argument has the same semantic as with the `query::proximity(...)`
[function](../geometric_queries/#proximity). The `dispatcher` argument is a
trait-object that is responsible for instantiating the correct proximity
algorithm for a given pair of shapes. This is useful when the proximity
determination algorithm is recursive, e.g., for [composite
shapes](../geometric_representations/#composite-shapes). This trait-object of
type `narrow_phase::ProximityDispatcher` has only one method that may return
`None` if no algorithm is known for the given shapes:

| Method                           | Description |
|--                                | --          |
| `.get_proximity_algorithm(a,Â b)` | Returns the persistent proximity determination algorithm dedicated to the shapes `a` and `b`. |

The `narrow_phase::ProximityAlgorithm` return type is just an alias for a boxed
`ProximityDetector` trait-object.

If you are not interested by the whole collision detection pipeline but only by
the persistent proximity determination algorithms, the
`narrow_phase::DefaultProximityDispatcher` can be used alone to retrieve the
correct proximity detection algorithm, depending on your geometries:

```rust
let dispatcher = DefaultProximityDispatcher2::new();
let shape1 = Ball::new(0.5f32);
let shape2 = Cylinder::new(0.5f32, 1.0);
let shape3 = Cone::new(0.5f32, 1.0);

let ball_vs_cylinder_detector = dispatcher.get_proximity_algorithm(&shape1, &shape2);
let ball_vs_cone_detector     = dispatcher.get_proximity_algorithm(&shape1, &shape3);
let cylinder_vs_cone_detector = dispatcher.get_proximity_algorithm(&shape2, &shape3);
```

## Persistent contact generation

Persistent contact generation follows the same logic as persistent proximity
detection, but for  multiple contact points computation. Contact generators
implement the `narrow_phase::ContactGenerator` trait.

| Method | Description |
|--      | --          |
| `.update(...)`     | Given the two shapes and their position, determines their contact geometry without returning it. |
| `.num_contacts() ` | The number of contacts generated by the last update.  |
| `.contacts(out)`   | Collects to `out` the contacts generated by the last update. |

Just like the proximity detectors, the `.update(...)` method requires a
dispatcher which is a trait-object of type `ContactDispatcher` with one
method that may return `None` if no algorithm is known for the given shapes:

| Method                           | Description |
|--                                | --          |
| `.get_contact_algorithm(a,Â b)` | Returns the persistent contact computation algorithm dedicated to the shapes `a` and `b`. |

The `narrow_phase::ContactAlgorithm` return type is just an alias for a boxed
`ContactGenerator` trait-object.

If you are not interested by the whole collision detection pipeline but only by
the persistent contact determination algorithms, the
`narrow_phase::DefaultContactDispatcher` can be used alone to retrieve the
correct collision detection algorithm, depending on your geometries:

```rust
let dispatcher = DefaultContactDispatcher2::new();
let shape1 = Ball::new(0.5f32);
let shape2 = Cylinder::new(0.5f32, 1.0);
let shape3 = Cone::new(0.5f32, 1.0);

let ball_vs_cylinder_detector = dispatcher.get_contact_algorithm(&shape1, &shape2);
let ball_vs_cone_detector     = dispatcher.get_contact_algorithm(&shape1, &shape3);
let cylinder_vs_cone_detector = dispatcher.get_contact_algorithm(&shape2, &shape3);
```

### Conforming contacts
Most contact generators implemented on **ncollide** are limited to one punctual
contacts. Therefore if you have a cube lying on a plane, only one contact will
be returned (left) instead of a theoretically infinite set of point (right):

<center>
![](../img/conforming_contact.svg)
</center>


Those planar contacts that cannot be assimilated to a single point are called
_conforming contacts_. Approximating the shape of such contact with more than
one point is critical for, e.g., physics simulation applications with contact
laws based exclusively on a discrete number of isolated points. The following
figure shows what would happen on this kind of physics simulation with a
conforming contact approximated by only one point:

<center>
![](../img/contact.svg)
</center>

Here, the cube is falling toward the plane. When a contact is detected, the
cube is penetrating the plane and the physics engine will try to correct this
situation by applying a force to the contact point. This makes the object
rotate unrealistically, moving the contact point to the over side.  This
alternation between two contact points due to unwanted rotations makes the
simulation unstable and unrealistic. That is why **ncollide** provides contact
determination algorithms wrappers that can generate a full contact manifold
either incrementally or in a single shot.

### Incremental contact manifold generation
The `narrow_phase::IncrementalContactManifoldGenerator` stores the results of the
wrapped collision detector, and updates them as the objects involved in the
contact move. After a few updates, a full manifold will be created:

<center>
![](../img/acc_contact.svg)
</center>

Obviously, storing the contact points at each update indefinitely is costly
and not necessary. This is why if more than 2 (resp. 4) contacts in 2D (resp.
3D) are stored, the surplus will be removed. This removal is smart enough to
maximize the area spanned by the remaining contact points. For example, the red
contact has been removed from the last part of the previous figure because it
is less significant than the two others.

The `IncrementalContactManifoldGenerator` can be used to wrap any structure
that implements the `ContactGenerator` trait and that generates a single
contact point:

```rust
let single_point_generator  = PlaneSupportMapContactGenerator2::new();
let full_manifold_generator = IncrementalContactManifoldGenerator::new(plane_vs_support_map);
```

### One-shot contact manifold generation
The `narrow_phase::OneShotContactManifoldGenerator` is slower but more accurate
than the incremental manifold generator as it is able to generate a full
manifold as soon as the first contact is detected. This is done by
virtually applying small rotations to one of the object in contact and
accumulating the new points generated by the wrapped collision detector.
Therefore, from the user point of view, a full manifold has been generated in
only one step:
<center>
![](../img/one_shot_contact.svg)
</center>

To reduce the computation times of this wrapper, the
`OneShotContactManifoldGenerator` stops this rotation-based algorithm and acts
like the incremental one as long as the manifold has been generated once.

The `OneShotContactManifoldGenerator` can be used to wrap any structure
that implements the `ContactGenerator` trait and that generates a single
contact point:

```rust
let single_point_generator  = PlaneSupportMapContactGenerator2::new();
let full_manifold_generator = OneShotContactManifoldGenerator::new(plane_vs_support_map);
```

# Collision world 
The `world::CollisionWorld` is expected to be the main interface between the
user and its geometrical scene. It groups:

* Geometrical shapes and their positions using so-called _collision objects_.
* A broad phase set to the `DBVTBroadPhase` by default.
* A narrow phase set to the  `DefaultNarrowPhase` by default.

All those are hidden between a high-level interface so that the user does not
have to manually modify and synchronize the various collision detection stages.
An empty collision world is created with the constructor
`CollisionWorld::new(margin, small_uids)`. Both arguments are only for
optimization purpose and have the same semantic as their
[counterparts](#the-dbvt-broad-phase) for the creation of the DBVT broad-phase:
the `margin` is the amount of loosening for each bounding volume (this does not
affect the exact geometric shapes). While this value depends on your specific
application, a value of 0.02 is usually good enough if your objects have an
average size of 1 (no matter which
[units](../faq/#which-units-are-used-by-ncollide) you use). The `small_uids`
flag indicates if your collision object identifiers will be small enough to be
indices of a `Vec` instead of a `HashMap`. It should be set to `false` if you
are not sure.

## Collision objects
Instances of the `world::CollisionObject` structure are the main citizens of the collision
world. They contain all information needed to describe a shape and its
position in space:

| Field               | Description                                                  |
|--                   | --                                                           |
| `.position`         | The collision object position in space.                      |
| `.shape`            | The geometrical shape of the collision object.               |
| `.collision_groups` | Groups used to prevent interactions with some other objects. |
| `.query_type`       | The kind of query this object can be involved in.            |
| `.data`             | User-defined data associated to this object. This will never be modified by **ncollide**. |

The two fields `.collision_groups` and `.query_type` affect how the object will
interact with the others on the collision world and are detailed in the next
sections.

A collision object should not be created directly by the user. Instead it
is initialized internally by the collision world with the
`CollisionWorld::add(uid, ...)` method. Its first argument is a unique
identifier of your choice that allows you to update this collision object
later. The `CollisionObject` instance created by the world can be retrieved
using the `.collision_object(uid)` method. Currently, a collision object can
only be moved or removed from the collision world. Future versions of
**ncollide** will allow you to modify its shape, collision groups, and query
types as well. All those modifications will wait until the next call to
`.update()` to be actually performed efficiently:

| Field                              | Description |
|--                                  | --          |
| `.deferred_set_position(uid, pos)` | Sets the position of the collision object identified by `uid` at the next update. |
| `.deferred_remove(uid)`            | Removes the collision object identified by `uid` at the next update. |

Adding an object with the same `uid` as another one already present on the
collision world will panic. In particular, keep in mind that because object
removal is deferred until the next update it is necessary to wait for the next
call to `.update()` in order to be able to re-use a removed object's
identifier. For example, the following (pseudo-code) panics:

```rust
collision_world.add(0, ...);
collision_world.update();
collision_world.deferred_remove(0);

collision_world.add(0, ...); // Panic! The uid 0 is already present.
```

While the following will work as expected:

```rust
collision_world.add(0, ...);
collision_world.update();
collision_world.deferred_remove(0);

collision_world.update();    // Actually remove 0 ...
collision_world.add(0, ...); // ... so it can be re-used for another object.
```

### Collision groups
Collision groups are the main way to prevent some object from interacting with
each other. Internally, it is represented as a few bit fields such that verifying
if two objects can interact is only a matter of performing bitwise operations.
The `world::CollisionGroups` structure defined three masks:

1. The **membership** mask âˆ’ the list of groups this collision object is part
   of.
2. The **whitelist** mask âˆ’ the list of groups this collision object can
   interact with if it is not blacklisted.
3. The **blacklist** mask âˆ’ the list of groups this collision object must never
   interact with.

Note that the blacklist has precedence over the whitelist, i.e., if a group is
on both lists, interactions will be forbidden anyway. Setting up a
`CollisionGroups` structure must follow the following reasoning: each object
can be member of several group. If it encounters another object, a geometric
query will be performed by the narrow phase if and only if:

* Each object is member of **at least one** group part of the other object's whitelist.
* **None** of the object is member of any group part of the other object's
  blacklist.

A collision group is identified by a positive number on the range $[\![ 0, 29 ]\!]$.
Thus, only 30 groups are available. By default, the `CollisionGroups::new()`
constructor will initialize the masks such that the object is member of all
groups, whitelists all groups, and blacklists none of them. You may modify,
set, or copy those masks with the corresponding methods prefixed by `.modify_`,
`.set_`, and `.copy_`.

Finally, there exists one special group for self-collision. Because this is
meaningful only for deformable shapes (which are not yet explicitly supported
by **ncollide**), it is disabled by default. It may be enabled with the
`.enable_self_collision()` method. This will allow the narrow phase to perform
a geometric query involving this collision object twice.

#### Example <div class="btn-primary" onclick="window.open('https://raw.githubusercontent.com/sebcrozet/ncollide/master/examples/collision_groups.rs')"></div>

In the following example, we have three `CollisionGroups` A, B, and C. The
first one is such that:

* It is member of the groups 1, 3, and 6.
* It whitelists the groups 6 and 7.
* It blacklists the group 1.

The second one is such that:

* It is member of the groups 1, 3, and 7.
* It whitelists the groups 3 and 7.
* It does not blacklist anything.

The third one is such that:

* It is member of the groups 6 and 9.
* It whitelists the groups 3 and 7.
* It does not blacklist anything.

As a result, we observe that:

* A and B will **not** interact because B is part of the group 1 which is
  blacklisted by A.
* B and C will **not** interact either because, even if C whitelists the group
  3 (which B is part of), B does not whitelists neither the group 6 nor the
  group 9 (which B is part of).
* A and C **will** interact because A whitelists the group 6 (which C is part
  of), and, reciprocally, C whitelists the group 3 (which A is part of).
  In addition, C is not part of the group 1 which is blacklisted by A.

```rust
let mut a = CollisionGroups::new();
let mut b = CollisionGroups::new();
let mut c = CollisionGroups::new();

a.set_membership(&[1, 3, 6]);
a.set_whitelist(&[6, 7]);
a.set_blacklist(&[1]);

b.set_membership(&[1, 3, 7]);
b.set_whitelist(&[3, 7]);

c.set_membership(&[6, 9]);
c.set_whitelist(&[3, 7]);

### Custom collision filters
If collision groups are not flexible enough for your specific needs, you may
register arbitrary filters with the collision world's
`.register_broad_phase_pair_filter(name, filter)` method. A filter may be
removed using his name with `.unregister_broad_phase_pair_filter(name)`.
Custom filters are called only if the collision groups do not reject the
interaction. If multiple filters are registered, they are applied successively
until one returns `false`. The interaction is allowed for the tested pair iff.
they all return `true`. A collision filter must implement the
`broad_phase::BroadPhasePairFilter` trait:

| Method                     | Description |
|--                          | --          |
| `.is_pair_valid(co1, co2)` | Returns `true` if the two collision objects are allowed to interact. |

The same _constancy_ rule as for the [broad phase](#broad-phase) `.update(...)`
filter argument applies here. If you which to modify you filter's semantic, it
has to be removed and re-added. 

The following examples add to the collision world a very arbitrary rule that
filters interactions in a way that would be impossible using collision groups.
We will allow interactions between collision objects with identifiers sharing
the same parity only.

#### 2D example <div class="d2" onclick="window.open('https://raw.githubusercontent.com/sebcrozet/ncollide/master/examples/custom_collision_filter2d.rs')"></div>

```rust
struct ParityFilter;

impl BroadPhasePairFilter<Point2<f32>, Isometry2<f32>, ()> for ParityFilter {
    fn is_pair_valid(&self,
                     b1: &CollisionObject2<f32, ()>,
                     b2: &CollisionObject2<f32, ()>)
                     -> bool {
        b1.uid % 2 == b2.uid % 2
    }
}
```

Then, this filter should be added to the collision world with:
```rust
world.register_broad_phase_pair_filter("Parity filter", ParityFilter);
```

#### 3D example <div class="d3" onclick="window.open('https://raw.githubusercontent.com/sebcrozet/ncollide/master/examples/custom_collision_filter3d.rs')"></div>

```rust
struct ParityFilter;

impl BroadPhasePairFilter<Point3<f32>, Isometry3<f32>, ()> for ParityFilter {
    fn is_pair_valid(&self,
                     b1: &CollisionObject3<f32, ()>,
                     b2: &CollisionObject3<f32, ()>)
                     -> bool {
        b1.uid % 2 == b2.uid % 2
    }
}
```

Then, this filter should be added to the collision world with:
```rust
world.register_broad_phase_pair_filter("Parity filter", ParityFilter);
```

### Query type
The query type stored in the `.query_type` field of collision objects indicates
which kind of geometric query should be executed by the narrow phase on it.
Two choices are given by the `world::GeometricQueryType` enumeration. More
queries for, e.g., minimal distance computation, may be allowed in the future:

1. `::Contacts(prediction)` âˆ’ two objects with this query
   type will have their [contact points](../geometric_queries/#contact)
   computed. Contact points will be generated as long as the two objects are
   penetrating or closer than the sum of both `prediction` values.
2. `::Proximity(margin)` âˆ’ if at least one object has this query type, then
   only [proximity detection](../geometric_queries/#proximity) will be
   performed. Shapes separated by a distance larger than the sum of their
   `margin` will be considered disjoint.

If the two shapes request different query types, only the simplest is
performed. For example, one shape having a `::Contacts(prediction1)` query type
interacting with a shape with a `::Proximity(margin2)` query type will result
in a proximity query. In other words, the first `::Contacts(...)` query type is
implicitly reinterpreted as `::Proximity(...)`.

## World-scale geometric queries
Because the collision world groups collision object with efficient acceleration
data structure, it is natural to give the user the ability to apply
[single-shape](./geometric_queries/#single-shape-queries) geometric queries to
all the objects at the same time:

| Method                 | Description |
|--                      | --          |
| `.interferences_with_ray(ray, groups)` | Returns an iterator through all objects able to interact with `groups` and intersecting `ray`. |
| `.interferences_with_point(point, groups)` | Returns an iterator through all objects able to interact with `groups` and containing `point`. |
| `.interferences_with_aabb(aabb, groups)` | Returns an iterator through all object that can interact with `groups` and with an AABB that intersects `aabb`.  |

Not all collision object have to be affected by the geometric query: only those
with a collision groups that can interact with `groups` will actually execute
the query. The results of pairwise geometric queries performed by the narrow
phase can be retrieved as well through the collision world:

| Method                | Description |
|--                     | --          |
| `.contact_pairs()`    | Gets an iterator through the contact pairs created by the narrow phase.   |
| `.proximity_pairs()`  | Gets an iterator through the proximity pairs created by the narrow phase. |
| `.contacts()`         | Gets an iterator through the contacts computed by the narrow phase.       |

## Event handling

## Example <div class="btn-primary" onclick="window.open('https://raw.githubusercontent.com/sebcrozet/ncollide/master/examples/bouncing_ball.rs')"></div>

The following example simulates the trajectory of a 2D ball trapped into a
square-shaped room. The room itself is split into four areas of different
colours. When the ball hits a wall, it bounce against it following a simple
reflection along the contact normal. The coloured areas act as sensors: a
message is printed when the ball enters and leaves each of them. Bouncing will
be reported by contact events while entering and leaving coloured areas will be
reported by proximity events. The proposed implementation may not be the most
efficient one but has the benefit to illustrate several features of the
collision detection pipeline.

<center>
![bouncing balls](../img/bouncing_ball.gif)
</center>

We first define a `CollisionObjectData` structure that will be attached to our
collision objets. When a proximity or contact event occurs, we need to be able
to:

1. Identify each wall. We give each area a name as a string. This name will be
   directly used by the message printer as the ball enters or leaves the area.
   (Note that instead of a string we could have simply used the collision
   object `.uid` field to identify the wall.)
2. Be able to modify the ball velocity. Because **ncollide** provides immutable
   references to proximity objects involved in a proximity event, we have to
   use a `Cell` to benefit from interior mutability. The ball is the only one
   to have a velocity different than `None`.

```rust
#[derive(Clone)]
struct CollisionObjectData {
    pub name:     &'static str,
    pub velocity: Option<Cell<Vector2<f32>>>
}

impl CollisionObjectData {
    pub fn new(name: &'static str, velocity: Option<Vector2<f32>>) -> CollisionObjectData {
        let init_velocity;
        if let Some(velocity) = velocity {
            init_velocity = Some(Cell::new(velocity))
        }
        else {
            init_velocity = None
        }

        CollisionObjectData {
            name:     name,
            velocity: init_velocity
        }
    }
}
```

Our proximity handler `ProximityMessage` must implement the `ProximityHandler`
trait. When a proximity event occurs, we first find the area's name by taking
the one from the collision object without velocity. Then the new proximity
status is tested to display the corresponding message. The
`Proximity::WithinMargin` case will never occur because our collision objects
will be initialized with a zero proximity margin.

```rust
struct ProximityMessage;

impl ProximityHandler<Point2<f32>, Isometry2<f32>, CollisionObjectData> for ProximityMessage {
    fn handle_proximity(&mut self,
                        co1: &CollisionObject2<f32, CollisionObjectData>,
                        co2: &CollisionObject2<f32, CollisionObjectData>,
                        _:             Proximity,
                        new_proximity: Proximity) {
        // The collision object with a None velocity is the coloured area.
        let area_name;

        if co1.data.velocity.is_none() {
            area_name = co1.data.name;
        }
        else {
            area_name = co2.data.name;
        }

        if new_proximity == Proximity::Intersecting {
            println!("The ball enters the {} area.", area_name);
        }
        else if new_proximity == Proximity::Disjoint {
            println!("The ball leaves the {} area.", area_name);
        }
    }
}
```

Our contact handler `VelocityBouncer` must implement the `ContactHandler`
trait. We first collect the contacts with the wall. Because the contact starts,
we already have the guarantee that at least one contact is available. Then, the
velocity of the ball can be modified by flipping its component along the first
contact normal.

```rust
struct VelocityBouncer;

impl ContactHandler<Point2<f32>, Isometry2<f32>, CollisionObjectData> for VelocityBouncer {
    fn handle_contact_started(&mut self,
                              co1: &CollisionObject2<f32, CollisionObjectData>,
                              co2: &CollisionObject2<f32, CollisionObjectData>,
                              alg: &ContactAlgorithm2<f32>) {
        // NOTE: real-life applications would avoid this systematic allocation.
        let mut collector = Vec::new();
        alg.contacts(&mut collector);

        // The ball is the one with a non-None velocity.
        if let Some(ref vel) = co1.data.velocity {
            let normal = collector[0].normal;
            vel.set(vel.get() - 2.0 * na::dot(&vel.get(), &normal) * normal);
        }
        if let Some(ref vel) = co2.data.velocity {
            let normal = -collector[0].normal;
            vel.set(vel.get() - 2.0 * na::dot(&vel.get(), &normal) * normal);
        }
    }

    fn handle_contact_stopped(&mut self,
                              _: &CollisionObject2<f32, CollisionObjectData>,
                              _: &CollisionObject2<f32, CollisionObjectData>) {
        // We don't care.
    }
}
```

Finally, we have to setup the collision world:

1. Initialize the shapes. All the coloured areas can share the same cuboid.
2. Initialize the collision groups. We do not want any proximity event to be
   reported between two coloured areas or between a wall and coloured area.  We
   do not want to detect contacts between two planes either. This filtering is
   easily done using [collision groups](#collision-groups). The ball is
   member of a group different from all the other objects. Then, the other
   objects whitelist the ball only so that they will not interact with each
   other.
3. Add our event handlers and collision objects to the world.

The final loop simply retrieve the ball's velocity and computes/sets its next
position.

```rust
/*
 * Setup initial object properties.

let plane_left   = ShapeHandle2::new(Plane::new(Vector2::x()));

];

// Position of the ball.
let ball_pos = Isometry2::new(Vector2::new(5.0, 5.0), na::zero());

// The ball is part of group 1 and can interact with everything.
let mut ball_groups = CollisionGroups::new();
ball_groups.set_membership(&[1]);

// All the other objects are part of the group 2 and interact only with the ball (but not with
// each other).
let mut others_groups = CollisionGroups::new();
others_groups.set_membership(&[2]);
others_groups.set_whitelist(&[1]);
